  var str = "ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WO\nNDERLAND [Illustration] \nI--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE \nAlice was beginning to g\net very tired of sitting\n by her sister on the ba\nnk, and of having nothin\ng to do. Once or twice s\nhe had peeped into the b\nook her sister was readi\nng, but it had no pictur\nes or conversations in i\nt, \"and what is the use\n of a book,\" thought Al\nice, \"without pictures \nor conversations?\" So s\nhe was considering in he\nr own mind (as well as s\nhe could, for the day ma\nde her feel very sleepy \nand stupid), whether the\n pleasure of making a da\nisy-chain would be worth\n the trouble of getting \nup and picking the daisi\nes, when suddenly a Whit\ne Rabbit with pink eyes \nran close by her. There \nwas nothing so very rema\nrkable in that, nor did \nAlice think it so very m\nuch out of the way to he\nar the Rabbit say to its\nelf, \"Oh dear! Oh dear!\n I shall be too late!\" \nBut when the Rabbit actu\nally took a watch out of\n its waistcoat-pocket an\nd looked at it and then \nhurried on, Alice starte\nd to her feet, for it fl\nashed across her mind th\nat she had never before \nseen a rabbit with eithe\nr a waistcoat-pocket, or\n a watch to take out of \nit, and, burning with cu\nriosity, she ran across \nthe field after it and w\nas just in time to see i\nt pop down a large rabbi\nt-hole, under the hedge.\n In another moment, down\n went Alice after it! [I\nllustration] The rabbit-\nhole went straight on li\nke a tunnel for some way\n and then dipped suddenl\ny down, so suddenly that\n Alice had not a moment \nto think about stopping \nherself before she found\n herself falling down wh\nat seemed to be a very d\neep well. Either the wel\nl was very deep, or she \nfell very slowly, for sh\ne had plenty of time, as\n she went down, to look \nabout her. First, she tr\nied to make out what she\n was coming to, but it w\nas too dark to see anyth\ning; then she looked at \nthe sides of the well an\nd noticed that they were\n filled with cupboards a\nnd book-shelves; here an\nd there she saw maps and\n pictures hung upon pegs\n. She took down a jar fr\nom one of the shelves as\n she passed. It was labe\nled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\n\" but, to her great disa\nppointment, it was empty\n; she did not like to dr\nop the jar, so managed t\no put it into one of the\n cupboards as she fell p\nast it. Down, down, down\n! Would the fall never c\nome to an end? There was\n nothing else to do, so \nAlice soon began talking\n to herself. \"Dinah'll \nmiss me very much to-nig\nht, I should think!\" (D\ninah was the cat.) \"I h\nope they'll remember her\n saucer of milk at tea-t\nime. Dinah, my dear, I w\nish you were down here w\nith me!\" Alice felt tha\nt she was dozing off, wh\nen suddenly, thump! thum\np! down she came upon a \nheap of sticks and dry l\neaves, and the fall was \nover. Alice was not a bi\nt hurt, and she jumped u\np in a moment. She looke\nd up, but it was all dar\nk overhead; before her w\nas another long passage \nand the White Rabbit was\n still in sight, hurryin\ng down it. There was not\n a moment to be lost. Aw\nay went Alice like the w\nind and was just in time\n to hear it say, as it t\nurned a corner, \"Oh, my\n ears and whiskers, how \nlate it's getting!\" She\n was close behind it whe\nn she turned the corner,\n but the Rabbit was no l\nonger to be seen. She fo\nund herself in a long, l\now hall, which was lit u\np by a row of lamps hang\ning from the roof. There\n were doors all 'round t\nhe hall, but they were a\nll locked; and when Alic\ne had been all the way d\nown one side and up the \nother, trying every door\n, she walked sadly down \nthe middle, wondering ho\nw she was ever to get ou\nt again. Suddenly she ca\nme upon a little table, \nall made of solid glass.\n There was nothing on it\n but a tiny golden key, \nand Alice's first idea w\nas that this might belon\ng to one of the doors of\n the hall; but, alas! ei\nther the locks were too \nlarge, or the key was to\no small, but, at any rat\ne, it would not open any\n of them. However, on th\ne second time 'round, sh\ne came upon a low curtai\nn she had not noticed be\nfore, and behind it was \na little door about fift\neen inches high. She tri\ned the little golden key\n in the lock, and to her\n great delight, it fitte\nd! [Illustration] Alice \nopened the door and foun\nd that it led into a sma\nll passage, not much lar\nger than a rat-hole; she\n knelt down and looked a\nlong the passage into th\ne loveliest garden you e\nver saw. How she longed \nto get out of that dark \nhall and wander about am\nong those beds of bright\n flowers and those cool \nfountains, but she could\n not even get her head t\nhrough the doorway. \"Oh\n,\" said Alice, \"how I \nwish I could shut up lik\ne a telescope! I think I\n could, if I only knew h\now to begin.\" Alice wen\nt back to the table, hal\nf hoping she might find \nanother key on it, or at\n any rate, a book of rul\nes for shutting people u\np like telescopes. This \ntime she found a little \nbottle on it (\"which ce\nrtainly was not here bef\nore,\" said Alice), and \ntied 'round the neck of \nthe bottle was a paper l\nabel, with the words \"D\nRINK ME\" beautifully pr\ninted on it in large let\nters. \"No, I'll look fi\nrst,\" she said, \"and s\nee whether it's marked '\n_poison_' or not,\" for \nshe had never forgotten \nthat, if you drink from \na bottle marked \"poison\n,\" it is almost certain\n to disagree with you, s\nooner or later. However,\n this bottle was _not_ m\narked \"poison,\" so Ali\nce ventured to taste it,\n and, finding it very ni\nce (it had a sort of mix\ned flavor of cherry-tart\n, custard, pineapple, ro\nast turkey, toffy and ho\nt buttered toast), she v\nery soon finished it off\n. * * * * * \"What a cur\nious feeling!\" said Ali\nce. \"I must be shutting\n up like a telescope!\" \nAnd so it was indeed! Sh\ne was now only ten inche\ns high, and her face bri\nghtened up at the though\nt that she was now the r\night size for going thro\nugh the little door into\n that lovely garden. Aft\ner awhile, finding that \nnothing more happened, s\nhe decided on going into\n the garden at once; but\n, alas for poor Alice! W\nhen she got to the door,\n she found she had forgo\ntten the little golden k\ney, and when she went ba\nck to the table for it, \nshe found she could not \npossibly reach it: she c\nould see it quite plainl\ny through the glass and \nshe tried her best to cl\nimb up one of the legs o\nf the table, but it was \ntoo slippery, and when s\nhe had tired herself out\n with trying, the poor l\nittle thing sat down and\n cried. \"Come, there's \nno use in crying like th\nat!\" said Alice to hers\nelf rather sharply. \"I \nadvise you to leave off \nthis minute!\" She gener\nally gave herself very g\nood advice (though she v\nery seldom followed it),\n and sometimes she scold\ned herself so severely a\ns to bring tears into he\nr eyes. Soon her eye fel\nl on a little glass box \nthat was lying under the\n table: she opened it an\nd found in it a very sma\nll cake, on which the wo\nrds \"EAT ME\" were beau\ntifully marked in curran\nts. \"Well, I'll eat it,\n\" said Alice, \"and if \nit makes me grow larger,\n I can reach the key; an\nd if it makes me grow sm\naller, I can creep under\n the door: so either way\n I'll get into the garde\nn, and I don't care whic\nh happens!\" She ate a l\nittle bit and said anxio\nusly to herself, \"Which\n way? Which way?\" holdi\nng her hand on the top o\nf her head to feel which\n way she was growing; an\nd she was quite surprise\nd to find that she remai\nned the same size. So sh\ne set to work and very s\noon finished off the cak\ne. [Illustration] II--TH\nE POOL OF TEARS \"Curiou\nser and curiouser!\" cri\ned Alice (she was so muc\nh surprised that for the\n moment she quite forgot\n how to speak good Engli\nsh). \"Now I'm opening o\nut like the largest tele\nscope that ever was! Goo\nd-by, feet! Oh, my poor \nlittle feet, I wonder wh\no will put on your shoes\n and stockings for you n\now, dears? I shall be a \ngreat deal too far off t\no trouble myself about y\nou.\" Just at this momen\nt her head struck agains\nt the roof of the hall; \nin fact, she was now rat\nher more than nine feet \nhigh, and she at once to\nok up the little golden \nkey and hurried off to t\nhe garden door. Poor Ali\nce! It was as much as sh\ne could do, lying down o\nn one side, to look thro\nugh into the garden with\n one eye; but to get thr\nough was more hopeless t\nhan ever. She sat down a\nnd began to cry again. S\nhe went on shedding gall\nons of tears, until ther\ne was a large pool all '\nround her and reaching h\nalf down the hall. After\n a time, she heard a lit\ntle pattering of feet in\n the distance and she ha\nstily dried her eyes to \nsee what was coming. It \nwas the White Rabbit ret\nurning, splendidly dress\ned, with a pair of white\n kid-gloves in one hand \nand a large fan in the o\nther. He came trotting a\nlong in a great hurry, m\nuttering to himself, \"O\nh! the Duchess, the Duch\ness! Oh! _won't_ she be \nsavage if I've kept her \nwaiting!\" When the Rabb\nit came near her, Alice \nbegan, in a low, timid v\noice, \"If you please, s\nir--\" The Rabbit starte\nd violently, dropped the\n white kid-gloves and th\ne fan and skurried away \ninto the darkness as har\nd as he could go. [Illus\ntration] Alice took up t\nhe fan and gloves and sh\ne kept fanning herself a\nll the time she went on \ntalking. \"Dear, dear! H\now queer everything is t\no-day! And yesterday thi\nngs went on just as usua\nl. _Was_ I the same when\n I got up this morning? \nBut if I'm not the same,\n the next question is, '\nWho in the world am I?' \nAh, _that's_ the great p\nuzzle!\" As she said thi\ns, she looked down at he\nr hands and was surprise\nd to see that she had pu\nt on one of the Rabbit's\n little white kid-gloves\n while she was talking. \n\"How _can_ I have done \nthat?\" she thought. \"I\n must be growing small a\ngain.\" She got up and w\nent to the table to meas\nure herself by it and fo\nund that she was now abo\nut two feet high and was\n going on shrinking rapi\ndly. She soon found out \nthat the cause of this w\nas the fan she was holdi\nng and she dropped it ha\nstily, just in time to s\nave herself from shrinki\nng away altogether. \"Th\nat _was_ a narrow escape\n!\" said Alice, a good d\neal frightened at the su\ndden change, but very gl\nad to find herself still\n in existence. \"And now\n for the garden!\" And s\nhe ran with all speed ba\nck to the little door; b\nut, alas! the little doo\nr was shut again and the\n little golden key was l\nying on the glass table \nas before. \"Things are \nworse than ever,\" thoug\nht the poor child, \"for\n I never was so small as\n this before, never!\" A\ns she said these words, \nher foot slipped, and in\n another moment, splash!\n she was up to her chin \nin salt-water. Her first\n idea was that she had s\nomehow fallen into the s\nea. However, she soon ma\nde out that she was in t\nhe pool of tears which s\nhe had wept when she was\n nine feet high. [Illust\nration] Just then she he\nard something splashing \nabout in the pool a litt\nle way off, and she swam\n nearer to see what it w\nas: she soon made out th\nat it was only a mouse t\nhat had slipped in like \nherself. \"Would it be o\nf any use, now,\" though\nt Alice, \"to speak to t\nhis mouse? Everything is\n so out-of-the-way down \nhere that I should think\n very likely it can talk\n; at any rate, there's n\no harm in trying.\" So s\nhe began, \"O Mouse, do \nyou know the way out of \nthis pool? I am very tir\ned of swimming about her\ne, O Mouse!\" The Mouse \nlooked at her rather inq\nuisitively and seemed to\n her to wink with one of\n its little eyes, but it\n said nothing. \"Perhaps\n it doesn't understand E\nnglish,\" thought Alice.\n \"I dare say it's a Fre\nnch mouse, come over wit\nh William the Conqueror.\n\" So she began again: \n\"Où est ma chatte?\" whi\nch was the first sentenc\ne in her French lesson-b\nook. The Mouse gave a su\ndden leap out of the wat\ner and seemed to quiver \nall over with fright. \"\nOh, I beg your pardon!\"\n cried Alice hastily, af\nraid that she had hurt t\nhe poor animal's feeling\ns. \"I quite forgot you \ndidn't like cats.\" \"No\nt like cats!\" cried the\n Mouse in a shrill, pass\nionate voice. \"Would _y\nou_ like cats, if you we\nre me?\" \"Well, perhaps\n not,\" said Alice in a \nsoothing tone; \"don't b\ne angry about it. And ye\nt I wish I could show yo\nu our cat Dinah. I think\n you'd take a fancy to c\nats, if you could only s\nee her. She is such a de\nar, quiet thing.\" The M\nouse was bristling all o\nver and she felt certain\n it must be really offen\nded. \"We won't talk abo\nut her any more, if you'\nd rather not.\" \"We, in\ndeed!\" cried the Mouse,\n who was trembling down \nto the end of its tail. \n\"As if _I_ would talk o\nn such a subject! Our fa\nmily always _hated_ cats\n--nasty, low, vulgar thi\nngs! Don't let me hear t\nhe name again!\" [Illust\nration: Alice at the Mad\n Tea Party.] \"I won't i\nndeed!\" said Alice, in \na great hurry to change \nthe subject of conversat\nion. \"Are you--are you \nfond--of--of dogs? There\n is such a nice little d\nog near our house, I sho\nuld like to show you! It\n kills all the rats and-\n-oh, dear!\" cried Alice\n in a sorrowful tone. \"\nI'm afraid I've offended\n it again!\" For the Mou\nse was swimming away fro\nm her as hard as it coul\nd go, and making quite a\n commotion in the pool a\ns it went. So she called\n softly after it, \"Mous\ne dear! Do come back aga\nin, and we won't talk ab\nout cats, or dogs either\n, if you don't like them\n!\" When the Mouse heard\n this, it turned 'round \nand swam slowly back to \nher; its face was quite \npale, and it said, in a \nlow, trembling voice, \"\nLet us get to the shore \nand then I'll tell you m\ny history and you'll und\nerstand why it is I hate\n cats and dogs.\" It was\n high time to go, for th\ne pool was getting quite\n crowded with the birds \nand animals that had fal\nlen into it; there were \na Duck and a Dodo, a Lor\ny and an Eaglet, and sev\neral other curious creat\nures. Alice led the way \nand the whole party swam\n to the shore. [Illustra\ntion] III--A CAUCUS-RACE\n AND A LONG TALE They we\nre indeed a queer-lookin\ng party that assembled o\nn the bank--the birds wi\nth draggled feathers, th\ne animals with their fur\n clinging close to them,\n and all dripping wet, c\nross and uncomfortable. \n[Illustration] The first\n question, of course, wa\ns how to get dry again. \nThey had a consultation \nabout this and after a f\new minutes, it seemed qu\nite natural to Alice to \nfind herself talking fam\niliarly with them, as if\n she had known them all \nher life. At last the Mo\nuse, who seemed to be a \nperson of some authority\n among them, called out,\n \"Sit down, all of you,\n and listen to me! _I'll\n_ soon make you dry enou\ngh!\" They all sat down \nat once, in a large ring\n, with the Mouse in the \nmiddle. \"Ahem!\" said t\nhe Mouse with an importa\nnt air. \"Are you all re\nady? This is the driest \nthing I know. Silence al\nl 'round, if you please!\n 'William the Conqueror,\n whose cause was favored\n by the pope, was soon s\nubmitted to by the Engli\nsh, who wanted leaders, \nand had been of late muc\nh accustomed to usurpati\non and conquest. Edwin a\nnd Morcar, the Earls of \nMercia and Northumbria'-\n-\" \"Ugh!\" said the Lo\nry, with a shiver. \"--'\nAnd even Stigand, the pa\ntriotic archbishop of Ca\nnterbury, found it advis\nable'--\" \"Found _what_\n?\" said the Duck. \"Fou\nnd _it_,\" the Mouse rep\nlied rather crossly; \"o\nf course, you know what \n'it' means.\" \"I know w\nhat 'it' means well enou\ngh, when _I_ find a thin\ng,\" said the Duck; \"it\n's generally a frog or a\n worm. The question is, \nwhat did the archbishop \nfind?\" The Mouse did no\nt notice this question, \nbut hurriedly went on, \n\"'--found it advisable t\no go with Edgar Atheling\n to meet William and off\ner him the crown.'--How \nare you getting on now, \nmy dear?\" it continued,\n turning to Alice as it \nspoke. \"As wet as ever,\n\" said Alice in a melan\ncholy tone; \"it doesn't\n seem to dry me at all.\n\" \"In that case,\" said\n the Dodo solemnly, risi\nng to its feet, \"I move\n that the meeting adjour\nn, for the immediate ado\nption of more energetic \nremedies--\" \"Speak Eng\nlish!\" said the Eaglet.\n \"I don't know the mean\ning of half those long w\nords, and, what's more, \nI don't believe you do e\nither!\" \"What I was go\ning to say,\" said the D\nodo in an offended tone,\n \"is that the best thin\ng to get us dry would be\n a Caucus-race.\" \"What\n _is_ a Caucus-race?\" s\naid Alice. [Illustration\n] \"Why,\" said the Dodo\n, \"the best way to expl\nain it is to do it.\" Fi\nrst it marked out a race\n-course, in a sort of ci\nrcle, and then all the p\narty were placed along t\nhe course, here and ther\ne. There was no \"One, t\nwo, three and away!\" bu\nt they began running whe\nn they liked and left of\nf when they liked, so th\nat it was not easy to kn\now when the race was ove\nr. However, when they ha\nd been running half an h\nour or so and were quite\n dry again, the Dodo sud\ndenly called out, \"The \nrace is over!\" and they\n all crowded 'round it, \npanting and asking, \"Bu\nt who has won?\" This qu\nestion the Dodo could no\nt answer without a great\n deal of thought. At las\nt it said, \"_Everybody_\n has won, and _all_ must\n have prizes.\" \"But wh\no is to give the prizes?\n\" quite a chorus of voi\nces asked. \"Why, _she_,\n of course,\" said the D\nodo, pointing to Alice w\nith one finger; and the \nwhole party at once crow\nded 'round her, calling \nout, in a confused way, \n\"Prizes! Prizes!\" Alic\ne had no idea what to do\n, and in despair she put\n her hand into her pocke\nt and pulled out a box o\nf comfits (luckily the s\nalt-water had not got in\nto it) and handed them '\nround as prizes. There w\nas exactly one a-piece, \nall 'round. The next thi\nng was to eat the comfit\ns; this caused some nois\ne and confusion, as the \nlarge birds complained t\nhat they could not taste\n theirs, and the small o\nnes choked and had to be\n patted on the back. How\never, it was over at las\nt and they sat down agai\nn in a ring and begged t\nhe Mouse to tell them so\nmething more. \"You prom\nised to tell me your his\ntory, you know,\" said A\nlice, \"and why it is yo\nu hate--C and D,\" she a\ndded in a whisper, half \nafraid that it would be \noffended again. \"Mine i\ns a long and a sad tale!\n\" said the Mouse, turni\nng to Alice and sighing.\n \"It _is_ a long tail, \ncertainly,\" said Alice,\n looking down with wonde\nr at the Mouse's tail, \n\"but why do you call it \nsad?\" And she kept on p\nuzzling about it while t\nhe Mouse was speaking, s\no that her idea of the t\nale was something like t\nhis:-- \"Fury said to a \nmouse, That he met in th\ne house, 'Let us both go\n to law: _I_ will prosec\nute _you_.-- Come, I'll \ntake no denial: We must \nhave the trial; For real\nly this morning I've not\nhing to do.' Said the mo\nuse to the cur, 'Such a \ntrial, dear sir, With no\n jury or judge, would be\n wasting our breath.' 'I\n'll be judge, I'll be ju\nry,' said cunning old Fu\nry; 'I'll try the whole \ncause, and condemn you t\no death.'\" \"You are no\nt attending!\" said the \nMouse to Alice, severely\n. \"What are you thinkin\ng of?\" \"I beg your par\ndon,\" said Alice very h\numbly, \"you had got to \nthe fifth bend, I think?\n\" \"You insult me by ta\nlking such nonsense!\" s\naid the Mouse, getting u\np and walking away. \"Pl\nease come back and finis\nh your story!\" Alice ca\nlled after it. And the o\nthers all joined in chor\nus, \"Yes, please do!\" \nBut the Mouse only shook\n its head impatiently an\nd walked a little quicke\nr. \"I wish I had Dinah,\n our cat, here!\" said A\nlice. This caused a rema\nrkable sensation among t\nhe party. Some of the bi\nrds hurried off at once,\n and a Canary called out\n in a trembling voice, t\no its children, \"Come a\nway, my dears! It's high\n time you were all in be\nd!\" On various pretexts\n they all moved off and \nAlice was soon left alon\ne. \"I wish I hadn't men\ntioned Dinah! Nobody see\nms to like her down here\n and I'm sure she's the \nbest cat in the world!\"\n Poor Alice began to cry\n again, for she felt ver\ny lonely and low-spirite\nd. In a little while, ho\nwever, she again heard a\n little pattering of foo\ntsteps in the distance a\nnd she looked up eagerly\n. [Illustration] [Illust\nration] IV--THE RABBIT S\nENDS IN A LITTLE BILL It\n was the White Rabbit, t\nrotting slowly back agai\nn and looking anxiously \nabout as it went, as if \nit had lost something; A\nlice heard it muttering \nto itself, \"The Duchess\n! The Duchess! Oh, my de\nar paws! Oh, my fur and \nwhiskers! She'll get me \nexecuted, as sure as fer\nrets are ferrets! Where \n_can_ I have dropped the\nm, I wonder?\" Alice gue\nssed in a moment that it\n was looking for the fan\n and the pair of white k\nid-gloves and she very g\nood-naturedly began hunt\ning about for them, but \nthey were nowhere to be \nseen--everything seemed \nto have changed since he\nr swim in the pool, and \nthe great hall, with the\n glass table and the lit\ntle door, had vanished c\nompletely. Very soon the\n Rabbit noticed Alice, a\nnd called to her, in an \nangry tone, \"Why, Mary \nAnn, what _are_ you doin\ng out here? Run home thi\ns moment and fetch me a \npair of gloves and a fan\n! Quick, now!\" \"He too\nk me for his housemaid!\n\" said Alice, as she ran\n off. \"How surprised he\n'll be when he finds out\n who I am!\" As she said\n this, she came upon a n\neat little house, on the\n door of which was a bri\nght brass plate with the\n name \"W. RABBIT\" engr\naved upon it. She went i\nn without knocking and h\nurried upstairs, in grea\nt fear lest she should m\neet the real Mary Ann an\nd be turned out of the h\nouse before she had foun\nd the fan and gloves. By\n this time, Alice had fo\nund her way into a tidy \nlittle room with a table\n in the window, and on i\nt a fan and two or three\n pairs of tiny white kid\n-gloves; she took up the\n fan and a pair of the g\nloves and was just going\n to leave the room, when\n her eyes fell upon a li\nttle bottle that stood n\near the looking-glass. S\nhe uncorked it and put i\nt to her lips, saying to\n herself, \"I do hope it\n'll make me grow large a\ngain, for, really, I'm q\nuite tired of being such\n a tiny little thing!\" \nBefore she had drunk hal\nf the bottle, she found \nher head pressing agains\nt the ceiling, and had t\no stoop to save her neck\n from being broken. She \nhastily put down the bot\ntle, remarking, \"That's\n quite enough--I hope I \nsha'n't grow any more.\"\n Alas! It was too late t\no wish that! She went on\n growing and growing and\n very soon she had to kn\neel down on the floor. S\ntill she went on growing\n, and, as a last resourc\ne, she put one arm out o\nf the window and one foo\nt up the chimney, and sa\nid to herself, \"Now I c\nan do no more, whatever \nhappens. What _will_ bec\nome of me?\" [Illustrati\non] Luckily for Alice, t\nhe little magic bottle h\nad now had its full effe\nct and she grew no large\nr. After a few minutes s\nhe heard a voice outside\n and stopped to listen. \n\"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" \nsaid the voice. \"Fetch \nme my gloves this moment\n!\" Then came a little p\nattering of feet on the \nstairs. Alice knew it wa\ns the Rabbit coming to l\nook for her and she trem\nbled till she shook the \nhouse, quite forgetting \nthat she was now about a\n thousand times as large\n as the Rabbit and had n\no reason to be afraid of\n it. Presently the Rabbi\nt came up to the door an\nd tried to open it; but \nas the door opened inwar\nds and Alice's elbow was\n pressed hard against it\n, that attempt proved a \nfailure. Alice heard it \nsay to itself, \"Then I'\nll go 'round and get in \nat the window.\" \"_That\n_ you won't!\" thought A\nlice; and after waiting \ntill she fancied she hea\nrd the Rabbit just under\n the window, she suddenl\ny spread out her hand an\nd made a snatch in the a\nir. She did not get hold\n of anything, but she he\nard a little shriek and \na fall and a crash of br\noken glass, from which s\nhe concluded that it was\n just possible it had fa\nllen into a cucumber-fra\nme or something of that \nsort. Next came an angry\n voice--the Rabbit's--\"\nPat! Pat! Where are you?\n\" And then a voice she \nhad never heard before, \n\"Sure then, I'm here! D\nigging for apples, yer h\nonor!\" \"Here! Come and\n help me out of this! No\nw tell me, Pat, what's t\nhat in the window?\" \"S\nure, it's an arm, yer ho\nnor!\" \"Well, it's got \nno business there, at an\ny rate; go and take it a\nway!\" There was a long \nsilence after this and A\nlice could only hear whi\nspers now and then, and \nat last she spread out h\ner hand again and made a\nnother snatch in the air\n. This time there were _\ntwo_ little shrieks and \nmore sounds of broken gl\nass. \"I wonder what the\ny'll do next!\" thought \nAlice. \"As for pulling \nme out of the window, I \nonly wish they _could_!\n\" She waited for some ti\nme without hearing anyth\ning more. At last came a\n rumbling of little cart\n-wheels and the sound of\n a good many voices all \ntalking together. She ma\nde out the words: \"Wher\ne's the other ladder? Bi\nll's got the other--Bill\n! Here, Bill! Will the r\noof bear?--Who's to go d\nown the chimney?--Nay, _\nI_ sha'n't! _You_ do it!\n Here, Bill! The master \nsays you've got to go do\nwn the chimney!\" Alice \ndrew her foot as far dow\nn the chimney as she cou\nld and waited till she h\neard a little animal scr\natching and scrambling a\nbout in the chimney clos\ne above her; then she ga\nve one sharp kick and wa\nited to see what would h\nappen next. The first th\ning she heard was a gene\nral chorus of \"There go\nes Bill!\" then the Rabb\nit's voice alone--\"Catc\nh him, you by the hedge!\n\" Then silence and then\n another confusion of vo\nices--\"Hold up his head\n--Brandy now--Don't chok\ne him--What happened to \nyou?\" Last came a littl\ne feeble, squeaking voic\ne, \"Well, I hardly know\n--No more, thank ye. I'm\n better now--all I know \nis, something comes at m\ne like a Jack-in-the-box\n and up I goes like a sk\ny-rocket!\" After a minu\nte or two of silence, th\ney began moving about ag\nain, and Alice heard the\n Rabbit say, \"A barrowf\nul will do, to begin wit\nh.\" \"A barrowful of _w\nhat_?\" thought Alice. B\nut she had not long to d\noubt, for the next momen\nt a shower of little peb\nbles came rattling in at\n the window and some of \nthem hit her in the face\n. Alice noticed, with so\nme surprise, that the pe\nbbles were all turning i\nnto little cakes as they\n lay on the floor and a \nbright idea came into he\nr head. \"If I eat one o\nf these cakes,\" she tho\nught, \"it's sure to mak\ne _some_ change in my si\nze.\" So she swallowed o\nne of the cakes and was \ndelighted to find that s\nhe began shrinking direc\ntly. As soon as she was \nsmall enough to get thro\nugh the door, she ran ou\nt of the house and found\n quite a crowd of little\n animals and birds waiti\nng outside. They all mad\ne a rush at Alice the mo\nment she appeared, but s\nhe ran off as hard as sh\ne could and soon found h\nerself safe in a thick w\nood. [Illustration: \"Th\ne Duchess tucked her arm\n affectionately into Ali\nce's.\"] \"The first thi\nng I've got to do,\" sai\nd Alice to herself, as s\nhe wandered about in the\n wood, \"is to grow to m\ny right size again; and \nthe second thing is to f\nind my way into that lov\nely garden. I suppose I \nought to eat or drink so\nmething or other, but th\ne great question is 'Wha\nt?'\" Alice looked all a\nround her at the flowers\n and the blades of grass\n, but she could not see \nanything that looked lik\ne the right thing to eat\n or drink under the circ\numstances. There was a l\narge mushroom growing ne\nar her, about the same h\neight as herself. She st\nretched herself up on ti\nptoe and peeped over the\n edge and her eyes immed\niately met those of a la\nrge blue caterpillar, th\nat was sitting on the to\np, with its arms folded,\n quietly smoking a long \nhookah and taking not th\ne smallest notice of her\n or of anything else. [I\nllustration] V--ADVICE F\nROM A CATERPILLAR At las\nt the Caterpillar took t\nhe hookah out of its mou\nth and addressed Alice i\nn a languid, sleepy voic\ne. \"Who are _you_?\" sa\nid the Caterpillar. [Ill\nustration] Alice replied\n, rather shyly, \"I--I h\nardly know, sir, just at\n present--at least I kno\nw who I _was_ when I got\n up this morning, but I \nthink I must have change\nd several times since th\nen.\" \"What do you mean\n by that?\" said the Cat\nerpillar, sternly. \"Exp\nlain yourself!\" \"I can\n't explain _myself_, I'm\n afraid, sir,\" said Ali\nce, \"because I'm not my\nself, you see--being so \nmany different sizes in \na day is very confusing.\n\" She drew herself up a\nnd said very gravely, \"\nI think you ought to tel\nl me who _you_ are, firs\nt.\" \"Why?\" said the C\naterpillar. As Alice cou\nld not think of any good\n reason and the Caterpil\nlar seemed to be in a _v\nery_ unpleasant state of\n mind, she turned away. \n\"Come back!\" the Cater\npillar called after her.\n \"I've something import\nant to say!\" Alice turn\ned and came back again. \n\"Keep your temper,\" sa\nid the Caterpillar. \"Is\n that all?\" said Alice,\n swallowing down her ang\ner as well as she could.\n \"No,\" said the Caterp\nillar. It unfolded its a\nrms, took the hookah out\n of its mouth again, and\n said, \"So you think yo\nu're changed, do you?\" \n\"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\n\" said Alice. \"I can't\n remember things as I us\ned--and I don't keep the\n same size for ten minut\nes together!\" \"What si\nze do you want to be?\" \nasked the Caterpillar. \n\"Oh, I'm not particular \nas to size,\" Alice hast\nily replied, \"only one \ndoesn't like changing so\n often, you know. I shou\nld like to be a _little_\n larger, sir, if you wou\nldn't mind,\" said Alice\n. \"Three inches is such\n a wretched height to be\n.\" \"It is a very good \nheight indeed!\" said th\ne Caterpillar angrily, r\nearing itself upright as\n it spoke (it was exactl\ny three inches high). In\n a minute or two, the Ca\nterpillar got down off t\nhe mushroom and crawled \naway into the grass, mer\nely remarking, as it wen\nt, \"One side will make \nyou grow taller, and the\n other side will make yo\nu grow shorter.\" \"One \nside of _what_? The othe\nr side of _what_?\" thou\nght Alice to herself. \"\nOf the mushroom,\" said \nthe Caterpillar, just as\n if she had asked it alo\nud; and in another momen\nt, it was out of sight. \nAlice remained looking t\nhoughtfully at the mushr\noom for a minute, trying\n to make out which were \nthe two sides of it. At \nlast she stretched her a\nrms 'round it as far as \nthey would go, and broke\n off a bit of the edge w\nith each hand. \"And now\n which is which?\" she s\naid to herself, and nibb\nled a little of the righ\nt-hand bit to try the ef\nfect. The next moment sh\ne felt a violent blow un\nderneath her chin--it ha\nd struck her foot! She w\nas a good deal frightene\nd by this very sudden ch\nange, as she was shrinki\nng rapidly; so she set t\no work at once to eat so\nme of the other bit. Her\n chin was pressed so clo\nsely against her foot th\nat there was hardly room\n to open her mouth; but \nshe did it at last and m\nanaged to swallow a mors\nel of the left-hand bit.\n... \"Come, my head's fr\nee at last!\" said Alice\n; but all she could see,\n when she looked down, w\nas an immense length of \nneck, which seemed to ri\nse like a stalk out of a\n sea of green leaves tha\nt lay far below her. \"W\nhere _have_ my shoulders\n got to? And oh, my poor\n hands, how is it I can'\nt see you?\" She was del\nighted to find that her \nneck would bend about ea\nsily in any direction, l\nike a serpent. She had j\nust succeeded in curving\n it down into a graceful\n zigzag and was going to\n dive in among the leave\ns, when a sharp hiss mad\ne her draw back in a hur\nry--a large pigeon had f\nlown into her face and w\nas beating her violently\n with its wings. [Illust\nration] \"Serpent!\" cri\ned the Pigeon. \"I'm _no\nt_ a serpent!\" said Ali\nce indignantly. \"Let me\n alone!\" \"I've tried t\nhe roots of trees, and I\n've tried banks, and I'v\ne tried hedges,\" the Pi\ngeon went on, \"but thos\ne serpents! There's no p\nleasing them!\" Alice wa\ns more and more puzzled.\n \"As if it wasn't troub\nle enough hatching the e\nggs,\" said the Pigeon, \n\"but I must be on the l\nook-out for serpents, ni\nght and day! And just as\n I'd taken the highest t\nree in the wood,\" conti\nnued the Pigeon, raising\n its voice to a shriek, \n\"and just as I was thin\nking I should be free of\n them at last, they must\n needs come wriggling do\nwn from the sky! Ugh, Se\nrpent!\" \"But I'm _not_\n a serpent, I tell you!\n\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I\n'm a--I'm a little girl,\n\" she added rather doub\ntfully, as she remembere\nd the number of changes \nshe had gone through tha\nt day. \"You're looking \nfor eggs, I know _that_ \nwell enough,\" said the \nPigeon; \"and what does \nit matter to me whether \nyou're a little girl or \na serpent?\" \"It matter\ns a good deal to _me_,\"\n said Alice hastily; \"b\nut I'm not looking for e\nggs, as it happens, and \nif I was, I shouldn't wa\nnt _yours_--I don't like\n them raw.\" \"Well, be \noff, then!\" said the Pi\ngeon in a sulky tone, as\n it settled down again i\nnto its nest. Alice crou\nched down among the tree\ns as well as she could, \nfor her neck kept gettin\ng entangled among the br\nanches, and every now an\nd then she had to stop a\nnd untwist it. After awh\nile she remembered that \nshe still held the piece\ns of mushroom in her han\nds, and she set to work \nvery carefully, nibbling\n first at one and then a\nt the other, and growing\n sometimes taller and so\nmetimes shorter, until s\nhe had succeeded in brin\nging herself down to her\n usual height. It was so\n long since she had been\n anything near the right\n size that it felt quite\n strange at first. \"The\n next thing is to get in\nto that beautiful garden\n--how _is_ that to be do\nne, I wonder?\" As she s\naid this, she came sudde\nnly upon an open place, \nwith a little house in i\nt about four feet high. \n\"Whoever lives there,\"\n thought Alice, \"it'll \nnever do to come upon th\nem _this_ size; why, I s\nhould frighten them out \nof their wits!\" She did\n not venture to go near \nthe house till she had b\nrought herself down to n\nine inches high. VI--PIG\n AND PEPPER For a minute\n or two she stood lookin\ng at the house, when sud\ndenly a footman in liver\ny came running out of th\ne wood (judging by his f\nace only, she would have\n called him a fish)--and\n rapped loudly at the do\nor with his knuckles. It\n was opened by another f\nootman in livery, with a\n round face and large ey\nes like a frog. [Illustr\nation] The Fish-Footman \nbegan by producing from \nunder his arm a great le\ntter, and this he handed\n over to the other, sayi\nng, in a solemn tone, \"\nFor the Duchess. An invi\ntation from the Queen to\n play croquet.\" The Fro\ng-Footman repeated, in t\nhe same solemn tone, \"F\nrom the Queen. An invita\ntion for the Duchess to \nplay croquet.\" Then the\ny both bowed low and the\nir curls got entangled t\nogether. When Alice next\n peeped out, the Fish-Fo\notman was gone, and the \nother was sitting on the\n ground near the door, s\ntaring stupidly up into \nthe sky. Alice went timi\ndly up to the door and k\nnocked. \"There's no sor\nt of use in knocking,\" \nsaid the Footman, \"and \nthat for two reasons. Fi\nrst, because I'm on the \nsame side of the door as\n you are; secondly, beca\nuse they're making such \na noise inside, no one c\nould possibly hear you.\n\" And certainly there _w\nas_ a most extraordinary\n noise going on within--\na constant howling and s\nneezing, and every now a\nnd then a great crash, a\ns if a dish or kettle ha\nd been broken to pieces.\n \"How am I to get in?\"\n asked Alice. \"_Are_ yo\nu to get in at all?\" sa\nid the Footman. \"That's\n the first question, you\n know.\" Alice opened th\ne door and went in. The \ndoor led right into a la\nrge kitchen, which was f\null of smoke from one en\nd to the other; the Duch\ness was sitting on a thr\nee-legged stool in the m\niddle, nursing a baby; t\nhe cook was leaning over\n the fire, stirring a la\nrge caldron which seemed\n to be full of soup. \"T\nhere's certainly too muc\nh pepper in that soup!\"\n Alice said to herself, \nas well as she could for\n sneezing. Even the Duch\ness sneezed occasionally\n; and as for the baby, i\nt was sneezing and howli\nng alternately without a\n moment's pause. The onl\ny two creatures in the k\nitchen that did _not_ sn\neeze were the cook and a\n large cat, which was gr\ninning from ear to ear. \n\"Please would you tell \nme,\" said Alice, a litt\nle timidly, \"why your c\nat grins like that?\" \"\nIt's a Cheshire-Cat,\" s\naid the Duchess, \"and t\nhat's why.\" \"I didn't \nknow that Cheshire-Cats \nalways grinned; in fact,\n I didn't know that cats\n _could_ grin,\" said Al\nice. \"You don't know mu\nch,\" said the Duchess, \n\"and that's a fact.\" J\nust then the cook took t\nhe caldron of soup off t\nhe fire, and at once set\n to work throwing everyt\nhing within her reach at\n the Duchess and the bab\ny--the fire-irons came f\nirst; then followed a sh\nower of saucepans, plate\ns and dishes. The Duches\ns took no notice of them\n, even when they hit her\n, and the baby was howli\nng so much already that \nit was quite impossible \nto say whether the blows\n hurt it or not. \"Oh, _\nplease_ mind what you're\n doing!\" cried Alice, j\numping up and down in an\n agony of terror. \"Here\n! You may nurse it a bit\n, if you like!\" the Duc\nhess said to Alice, flin\nging the baby at her as \nshe spoke. \"I must go a\nnd get ready to play cro\nquet with the Queen,\" a\nnd she hurried out of th\ne room. Alice caught the\n baby with some difficul\nty, as it was a queer-sh\naped little creature and\n held out its arms and l\negs in all directions. \n\"If I don't take this ch\nild away with me,\" thou\nght Alice, \"they're sur\ne to kill it in a day or\n two. Wouldn't it be mur\nder to leave it behind?\n\" She said the last word\ns out loud and the littl\ne thing grunted in reply\n. \"If you're going to t\nurn into a pig, my dear,\n\" said Alice, \"I'll ha\nve nothing more to do wi\nth you. Mind now!\" Alic\ne was just beginning to \nthink to herself, \"Now,\n what am I to do with th\nis creature, when I get \nit home?\" when it grunt\ned again so violently th\nat Alice looked down int\no its face in some alarm\n. This time there could \nbe _no_ mistake about it\n--it was neither more no\nr less than a pig; so sh\ne set the little creatur\ne down and felt quite re\nlieved to see it trot aw\nay quietly into the wood\n. Alice was a little sta\nrtled by seeing the Ches\nhire-Cat sitting on a bo\nugh of a tree a few yard\ns off. The Cat only grin\nned when it saw her. \"C\nheshire-Puss,\" began Al\nice, rather timidly, \"w\nould you please tell me \nwhich way I ought to go \nfrom here?\" \"In _that_\n direction,\" the Cat sa\nid, waving the right paw\n 'round, \"lives a Hatte\nr; and in _that_ directi\non,\" waving the other p\naw, \"lives a March Hare\n. Visit either you like;\n they're both mad.\" \"B\nut I don't want to go am\nong mad people,\" Alice \nremarked. \"Oh, you can'\nt help that,\" said the \nCat; \"we're all mad her\ne. Do you play croquet w\nith the Queen to-day?\" \n\"I should like it very \nmuch,\" said Alice, \"bu\nt I haven't been invited\n yet.\" \"You'll see me \nthere,\" said the Cat, a\nnd vanished. Alice had n\not gone much farther bef\nore she came in sight of\n the house of the March \nHare; it was so large a \nhouse that she did not l\nike to go near till she \nhad nibbled some more of\n the left-hand bit of mu\nshroom. VII--A MAD TEA-P\nARTY There was a table s\net out under a tree in f\nront of the house, and t\nhe March Hare and the Ha\ntter were having tea at \nit; a Dormouse was sitti\nng between them, fast as\nleep. The table was a la\nrge one, but the three w\nere all crowded together\n at one corner of it. \"\nNo room! No room!\" they\n cried out when they saw\n Alice coming. \"There's\n _plenty_ of room!\" sai\nd Alice indignantly, and\n she sat down in a large\n arm-chair at one end of\n the table. The Hatter o\npened his eyes very wide\n on hearing this, but al\nl he said was \"Why is a\n raven like a writing-de\nsk?\" \"I'm glad they've\n begun asking riddles--I\n believe I can guess tha\nt,\" she added aloud. \"\nDo you mean that you thi\nnk you can find out the \nanswer to it?\" said the\n March Hare. \"Exactly s\no,\" said Alice. \"Then \nyou should say what you \nmean,\" the March Hare w\nent on. \"I do,\" Alice \nhastily replied; \"at le\nast--at least I mean wha\nt I say--that's the same\n thing, you know.\" \"Yo\nu might just as well say\n,\" added the Dormouse, \nwhich seemed to be talki\nng in its sleep, \"that \n'I breathe when I sleep'\n is the same thing as 'I\n sleep when I breathe!'\n\" \"It _is_ the same thi\nng with you,\" said the \nHatter, and he poured a \nlittle hot tea upon its \nnose. The Dormouse shook\n its head impatiently an\nd said, without opening \nits eyes, \"Of course, o\nf course; just what I wa\ns going to remark myself\n.\" [Illustration] \"Hav\ne you guessed the riddle\n yet?\" the Hatter said,\n turning to Alice again.\n \"No, I give it up,\" A\nlice replied. \"What's t\nhe answer?\" \"I haven't\n the slightest idea,\" s\naid the Hatter. \"Nor I,\n\" said the March Hare. \nAlice gave a weary sigh.\n \"I think you might do \nsomething better with th\ne time,\" she said, \"th\nan wasting it in asking \nriddles that have no ans\nwers.\" \"Take some more\n tea,\" the March Hare s\naid to Alice, very earne\nstly. \"I've had nothing\n yet,\" Alice replied in\n an offended tone, \"so \nI can't take more.\" \"Y\nou mean you can't take _\nless_,\" said the Hatter\n; \"it's very easy to ta\nke _more_ than nothing.\n\" At this, Alice got up \nand walked off. The Dorm\nouse fell asleep instant\nly and neither of the ot\nhers took the least noti\nce of her going, though \nshe looked back once or \ntwice; the last time she\n saw them, they were try\ning to put the Dormouse \ninto the tea-pot. [Illus\ntration: The Trial of th\ne Knave of Hearts.] \"At\n any rate, I'll never go\n _there_ again!\" said A\nlice, as she picked her \nway through the wood. \"\nIt's the stupidest tea-p\narty I ever was at in al\nl my life!\" Just as she\n said this, she noticed \nthat one of the trees ha\nd a door leading right i\nnto it. \"That's very cu\nrious!\" she thought. \"\nI think I may as well go\n in at once.\" And in sh\ne went. Once more she fo\nund herself in the long \nhall and close to the li\nttle glass table. Taking\n the little golden key, \nshe unlocked the door th\nat led into the garden. \nThen she set to work nib\nbling at the mushroom (s\nhe had kept a piece of i\nt in her pocket) till sh\ne was about a foot high;\n then she walked down th\ne little passage; and _t\nhen_--she found herself \nat last in the beautiful\n garden, among the brigh\nt flower-beds and the co\nol fountains. VIII--THE \nQUEEN'S CROQUET GROUND A\n large rose-tree stood n\near the entrance of the \ngarden; the roses growin\ng on it were white, but \nthere were three gardene\nrs at it, busily paintin\ng them red. Suddenly the\nir eyes chanced to fall \nupon Alice, as she stood\n watching them. \"Would \nyou tell me, please,\" s\naid Alice, a little timi\ndly, \"why you are paint\ning those roses?\" Five \nand Seven said nothing, \nbut looked at Two. Two b\negan, in a low voice, \"\nWhy, the fact is, you se\ne, Miss, this here ought\n to have been a _red_ ro\nse-tree, and we put a wh\nite one in by mistake; a\nnd, if the Queen was to \nfind it out, we should a\nll have our heads cut of\nf, you know. So you see,\n Miss, we're doing our b\nest, afore she comes, to\n--\" At this moment, Fiv\ne, who had been anxiousl\ny looking across the gar\nden, called out, \"The Q\nueen! The Queen!\" and t\nhe three gardeners insta\nntly threw themselves fl\nat upon their faces. The\nre was a sound of many f\nootsteps and Alice looke\nd 'round, eager to see t\nhe Queen. First came ten\n soldiers carrying clubs\n, with their hands and f\neet at the corners: next\n the ten courtiers; thes\ne were ornamented all ov\ner with diamonds. After \nthese came the royal chi\nldren; there were ten of\n them, all ornamented wi\nth hearts. Next came the\n guests, mostly Kings an\nd Queens, and among them\n Alice recognized the Wh\nite Rabbit. Then followe\nd the Knave of Hearts, c\narrying the King's crown\n on a crimson velvet cus\nhion; and last of all th\nis grand procession came\n THE KING AND THE QUEEN \nOF HEARTS. When the proc\nession came opposite to \nAlice, they all stopped \nand looked at her, and t\nhe Queen said severely, \n\"Who is this?\" She sai\nd it to the Knave of Hea\nrts, who only bowed and \nsmiled in reply. \"My na\nme is Alice, so please Y\nour Majesty,\" said Alic\ne very politely; but she\n added to herself, \"Why\n, they're only a pack of\n cards, after all!\" \"C\nan you play croquet?\" s\nhouted the Queen. The qu\nestion was evidently mea\nnt for Alice. \"Yes!\" s\naid Alice loudly. \"Come\n on, then!\" roared the \nQueen. \"It's--it's a ve\nry fine day!\" said a ti\nmid voice to Alice. She \nwas walking by the White\n Rabbit, who was peeping\n anxiously into her face\n. \"Very,\" said Alice. \n\"Where's the Duchess?\"\n \"Hush! Hush!\" said th\ne Rabbit. \"She's under \nsentence of execution.\"\n \"What for?\" said Alic\ne. \"She boxed the Queen\n's ears--\" the Rabbit b\negan. \"Get to your plac\nes!\" shouted the Queen \nin a voice of thunder, a\nnd people began running \nabout in all directions,\n tumbling up against eac\nh other. However, they g\not settled down in a min\nute or two, and the game\n began. Alice thought sh\ne had never seen such a \ncurious croquet-ground i\nn her life; it was all r\nidges and furrows. The c\nroquet balls were live h\nedgehogs, and the mallet\ns live flamingos and the\n soldiers had to double \nthemselves up and stand \non their hands and feet,\n to make the arches. The\n players all played at o\nnce, without waiting for\n turns, quarrelling all \nthe while and fighting f\nor the hedgehogs; and in\n a very short time, the \nQueen was in a furious p\nassion and went stamping\n about and shouting, \"O\nff with his head!\" or \n\"Off with her head!\" ab\nout once in a minute. \"\nThey're dreadfully fond \nof beheading people here\n,\" thought Alice; \"the\n great wonder is that th\nere's anyone left alive!\n\" She was looking about\n for some way of escape,\n when she noticed a curi\nous appearance in the ai\nr. \"It's the Cheshire-C\nat,\" she said to hersel\nf; \"now I shall have so\nmebody to talk to.\" \"H\now are you getting on?\"\n said the Cat. \"I don't\n think they play at all \nfairly,\" Alice said, in\n a rather complaining to\nne; \"and they all quarr\nel so dreadfully one can\n't hear oneself speak--a\nnd they don't seem to ha\nve any rules in particul\nar.\" \"How do you like \nthe Queen?\" said the Ca\nt in a low voice. \"Not \nat all,\" said Alice. [I\nllustration] Alice thoug\nht she might as well go \nback and see how the gam\ne was going on. So she w\nent off in search of her\n hedgehog. The hedgehog \nwas engaged in a fight w\nith another hedgehog, wh\nich seemed to Alice an e\nxcellent opportunity for\n croqueting one of them \nwith the other; the only\n difficulty was that her\n flamingo was gone acros\ns to the other side of t\nhe garden, where Alice c\nould see it trying, in a\n helpless sort of way, t\no fly up into a tree. Sh\ne caught the flamingo an\nd tucked it away under h\ner arm, that it might no\nt escape again. Just the\nn Alice ran across the D\nuchess (who was now out \nof prison). She tucked h\ner arm affectionately in\nto Alice's and they walk\ned off together. Alice w\nas very glad to find her\n in such a pleasant temp\ner. She was a little sta\nrtled, however, when she\n heard the voice of the \nDuchess close to her ear\n. \"You're thinking abou\nt something, my dear, an\nd that makes you forget \nto talk.\" \"The game's \ngoing on rather better n\now,\" Alice said, by way\n of keeping up the conve\nrsation a little. \"'Tis\n so,\" said the Duchess;\n \"and the moral of that\n is--'Oh, 'tis love, 'ti\ns love that makes the wo\nrld go 'round!'\" \"Some\nbody said,\" Alice whisp\nered, \"that it's done b\ny everybody minding his \nown business!\" \"Ah, we\nll! It means much the sa\nme thing,\" said the Duc\nhess, digging her sharp \nlittle chin into Alice's\n shoulder, as she added \n\"and the moral of _that\n_ is--'Take care of the \nsense and the sounds wil\nl take care of themselve\ns.'\" To Alice's great s\nurprise, the Duchess's a\nrm that was linked into \nhers began to tremble. A\nlice looked up and there\n stood the Queen in fron\nt of them, with her arms\n folded, frowning like a\n thunderstorm! \"Now, I \ngive you fair warning,\"\n shouted the Queen, stam\nping on the ground as sh\ne spoke, \"either you or\n your head must be off, \nand that in about half n\no time. Take your choice\n!\" The Duchess took her\n choice, and was gone in\n a moment. \"Let's go on\n with the game,\" the Qu\neen said to Alice; and A\nlice was too much fright\nened to say a word, but \nslowly followed her back\n to the croquet-ground. \nAll the time they were p\nlaying, the Queen never \nleft off quarreling with\n the other players and s\nhouting, \"Off with his \nhead!\" or \"Off with he\nr head!\" By the end of \nhalf an hour or so, all \nthe players, except the \nKing, the Queen and Alic\ne, were in custody of th\ne soldiers and under sen\ntence of execution. Then\n the Queen left off, qui\nte out of breath, and wa\nlked away with Alice. Al\nice heard the King say i\nn a low voice to the com\npany generally, \"You ar\ne all pardoned.\" Sudden\nly the cry \"The Trial's\n beginning!\" was heard \nin the distance, and Ali\nce ran along with the ot\nhers. IX--WHO STOLE THE \nTARTS? The King and Quee\nn of Hearts were seated \non their throne when the\ny arrived, with a great \ncrowd assembled about th\nem--all sorts of little \nbirds and beasts, as wel\nl as the whole pack of c\nards: the Knave was stan\nding before them, in cha\nins, with a soldier on e\nach side to guard him; a\nnd near the King was the\n White Rabbit, with a tr\numpet in one hand and a \nscroll of parchment in t\nhe other. In the very mi\nddle of the court was a \ntable, with a large dish\n of tarts upon it. \"I w\nish they'd get the trial\n done,\" Alice thought, \n\"and hand 'round the re\nfreshments!\" The judge,\n by the way, was the Kin\ng and he wore his crown \nover his great wig. \"Th\nat's the jury-box,\" tho\nught Alice; \"and those \ntwelve creatures (some w\nere animals and some wer\ne birds) I suppose they \nare the jurors.\" Just t\nhen the White Rabbit cri\ned out \"Silence in the \ncourt!\" \"Herald, read \nthe accusation!\" said t\nhe King. [Illustration] \nOn this, the White Rabbi\nt blew three blasts on t\nhe trumpet, then unrolle\nd the parchment-scroll a\nnd read as follows: \"Th\ne Queen of Hearts, she m\nade some tarts, All on a\n summer day; The Knave o\nf Hearts, he stole those\n tarts And took them qui\nte away!\" \"Call the fi\nrst witness,\" said the \nKing; and the White Rabb\nit blew three blasts on \nthe trumpet and called o\nut, \"First witness!\" T\nhe first witness was the\n Hatter. He came in with\n a teacup in one hand an\nd a piece of bread and b\nutter in the other. \"Yo\nu ought to have finished\n,\" said the King. \"Whe\nn did you begin?\" The H\natter looked at the Marc\nh Hare, who had followed\n him into the court, arm\n in arm with the Dormous\ne. \"Fourteenth of March\n, I _think_ it was,\" he\n said. \"Give your evide\nnce,\" said the King, \"\nand don't be nervous, or\n I'll have you executed \non the spot.\" This did \nnot seem to encourage th\ne witness at all; he kep\nt shifting from one foot\n to the other, looking u\nneasily at the Queen, an\nd, in his confusion, he \nbit a large piece out of\n his teacup instead of t\nhe bread and butter. Jus\nt at this moment Alice f\nelt a very curious sensa\ntion--she was beginning \nto grow larger again. Th\ne miserable Hatter dropp\ned his teacup and bread \nand butter and went down\n on one knee. \"I'm a po\nor man, Your Majesty,\" \nhe began. \"You're a _ve\nry_ poor _speaker_,\" sa\nid the King. \"You may g\no,\" said the King, and \nthe Hatter hurriedly lef\nt the court. \"Call the \nnext witness!\" said the\n King. The next witness \nwas the Duchess's cook. \nShe carried the pepper-b\nox in her hand and the p\neople near the door bega\nn sneezing all at once. \n\"Give your evidence,\" \nsaid the King. \"Sha'n't\n,\" said the cook. The K\ning looked anxiously at \nthe White Rabbit, who sa\nid, in a low voice, \"Yo\nur Majesty must cross-ex\namine _this_ witness.\" \n\"Well, if I must, I mus\nt,\" the King said. \"Wh\nat are tarts made of?\" \n\"Pepper, mostly,\" said\n the cook. For some minu\ntes the whole court was \nin confusion and by the \ntime they had settled do\nwn again, the cook had d\nisappeared. \"Never mind\n!\" said the King, \"cal\nl the next witness.\" Al\nice watched the White Ra\nbbit as he fumbled over \nthe list. Imagine her su\nrprise when he read out,\n at the top of his shril\nl little voice, the name\n \"Alice!\" X--ALICE'S E\nVIDENCE \"Here!\" cried \nAlice. She jumped up in \nsuch a hurry that she ti\npped over the jury-box, \nupsetting all the juryme\nn on to the heads of the\n crowd below. \"Oh, I _b\neg_ your pardon!\" she e\nxclaimed in a tone of gr\neat dismay. \"The trial \ncannot proceed,\" said t\nhe King, \"until all the\n jurymen are back in the\nir proper places--_all_,\n\" he repeated with grea\nt emphasis, looking hard\n at Alice. \"What do you\n know about this busines\ns?\" the King said to Al\nice. \"Nothing whatever,\n\" said Alice. The King \nthen read from his book:\n \"Rule forty-two. _All \npersons more than a mile\n high to leave the court\n_.\" \"_I'm_ not a mile \nhigh,\" said Alice. \"Ne\narly two miles high,\" s\naid the Queen. [Illustra\ntion] \"Well, I sha'n't \ngo, at any rate,\" said \nAlice. The King turned p\nale and shut his note-bo\nok hastily. \"Consider y\nour verdict,\" he said t\no the jury, in a low, tr\nembling voice. \"There's\n more evidence to come y\net, please Your Majesty,\n\" said the White Rabbit\n, jumping up in a great \nhurry. \"This paper has \njust been picked up. It \nseems to be a letter wri\ntten by the prisoner to-\n-to somebody.\" He unfol\nded the paper as he spok\ne and added, \"It isn't \na letter, after all; it'\ns a set of verses.\" \"P\nlease, Your Majesty,\" s\naid the Knave, \"I didn'\nt write it and they can'\nt prove that I did; ther\ne's no name signed at th\ne end.\" \"You _must_ ha\nve meant some mischief, \nor else you'd have signe\nd your name like an hone\nst man,\" said the King.\n There was a general cla\npping of hands at this. \n\"Read them,\" he added,\n turning to the White Ra\nbbit. There was dead sil\nence in the court whilst\n the White Rabbit read o\nut the verses. \"That's \nthe most important piece\n of evidence we've heard\n yet,\" said the King. \n\"_I_ don't believe there\n's an atom of meaning in\n it,\" ventured Alice. \n\"If there's no meaning i\nn it,\" said the King, \n\"that saves a world of t\nrouble, you know, as we \nneedn't try to find any.\n Let the jury consider t\nheir verdict.\" \"No, no\n!\" said the Queen. \"Se\nntence first--verdict af\nterwards.\" \"Stuff and \nnonsense!\" said Alice l\noudly. \"The idea of hav\ning the sentence first!\n\" \"Hold your tongue!\" \nsaid the Queen, turning \npurple. \"I won't!\" sai\nd Alice. \"Off with her \nhead!\" the Queen shoute\nd at the top of her voic\ne. Nobody moved. \"Who c\nares for _you_?\" said A\nlice (she had grown to h\ner full size by this tim\ne). \"You're nothing but\n a pack of cards!\" [Ill\nustration] At this, the \nwhole pack rose up in th\ne air and came flying do\nwn upon her; she gave a \nlittle scream, half of f\nright and half of anger,\n and tried to beat them \noff, and found herself l\nying on the bank, with h\ner head in the lap of he\nr sister, who was gently\n brushing away some dead\n leaves that had flutter\ned down from the trees u\npon her face. \"Wake up,\n Alice dear!\" said her \nsister. \"Why, what a lo\nng sleep you've had!\" \n\"Oh, I've had such a cur\nious dream!\" said Alice\n. And she told her siste\nr, as well as she could \nremember them, all these\n strange adventures of h\ners that you have just b\neen reading about. Alice\n got up and ran off, thi\nnking while she ran, as \nwell she might, what a w\nonderful dream it had be\nen.
